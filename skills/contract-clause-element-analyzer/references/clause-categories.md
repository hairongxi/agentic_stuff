4. **Mixed content**: Split into multiple entries if clause clearly contains distinct sections from different categories

## Common Ambiguities

| Clause Content | Primary Category | Reasoning |
|----------------|------------------|-----------|
| "违约金：合同金额的10%" | 商法 | Penalty for breach, not payment schedule |
| "质保金：合同总金额的5%" | 财经 | Financial amount withheld as security |
| "交货验收合格后7日内付款" | 财经 | Payment condition tied to delivery |
| "货物毁损由乙方承担" | 商法 | Liability clause, not delivery mechanics |
